What are the Important AWS Cloud Services?


In 2006, Amazon Web Services, 
(AWS) began offering IT services to the public in the form of web services commonly known as cloud computing. 
One of the key benefits of cloud computing is that it replaces upfront capital infrastructure expenses with an on-demand low-cost pay-as-you-go model. 
AWS made businesses no longer need to plan for and procure IT infrastructures weeks or months in advance. 
Instead, they can instantly select any number of servers and other technologies needed for them and it is delivered to them in minutes. 
Today, AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable, and low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in more than 190 countries around the world. 
AWS services are typically grouped into different categories like compute, networking, storage, applications, databases, and analytics.
